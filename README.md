Code-Snippets-JAVA-SCALA
========================

Some basic code snippets in Java and Scala programming language. 

Dumping ground for my codes. Serves as my practice ground. Not only a smart code but maintaining the aesthetics of 
code is equally important. This repository is an effort for GROOMING a piece of code. 

Suggestions Welcome and Happy Coding ;)
